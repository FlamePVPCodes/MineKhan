## 🛠️ Building the Project

To build the project locally:

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm run build` to build the project into the `dist` folder.
5. To start a local server, run `node index.js` (localhost:4000) or open the HTML file.

## 🧱 Compiling C Code to WASM

Compiling the `caves.c` file into WASM:

1. Install emscripten.
2. Run `emcc src/c/caves.c -o test.js -O3 -Os -sEXPORTED_FUNCTIONS=_getCaves -sERROR_ON_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS=0`. This will output a JS file and a .wasm file.
3. Delete the JS file.
4. Convert the .wasm file to base64 (you can find online tools for this).
5. Copy/paste the base64 content into the `workers/Caves.js` file.
